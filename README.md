# **Hackathon. Packer for Yandex Market.**

## Introduction

The project was started during a hackathon and focuses on the logistics problem faced by Yandex Market. It aims to efficiently pack orders into appropriate boxes, taking into account the number of items, type of cargo, and box characteristics such as prices and sizes.

## Data:

- **Order information**: Order information indicating the quantity of goods, their type of cargo (product type), the box in which the goods were packed by the collector.
- **Characteristics of containers**: There are prices and sizes of boxes.

## Data preparation:
- **Cleanup**: Removed all inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features for packaging prediction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted analysis to understand underlying patterns and distributions.

## Task

Build a model that will predict which packaging (type of package or box) an order should be placed in.

## Completed work

- Analyzed and prepared data,
- Trained the model, assessed the quality of the created model,
- Completed the ML product for development, implemented the build in Docker.

## Libraries used

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, catboost, xgboost, lightgbm

## Results

- The developed model showed encouraging results in predicting suitable packaging for various orders.
- Contributed to better space utilization, cost efficiency and optimization of the packaging process.

## Problems and conclusions

The problems encountered in the project and the conclusions obtained in overcoming them are described.

## Project status

**Completed** - The project is completed and the model has been successfully transferred to Yandex Market for analysis.

## Further work

Potential areas for further research and development, improving the performance of the model or expanding its application to other related areas in the organization.
